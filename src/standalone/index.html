	<h1>@superfleb/draggable<br /><code>draggable</code> and <code>windowMouse</code> demo</h1>
	<p>
		The <code>draggable()</code> window is initialized with the positioning coordinates of the window, and the
		<code>draggable</code> component will keep track of drag coordinates relative that, so there&rsquo;s no
		messy calculation between offset and client positions or keeping track of offsets yourself. You can click
		anywhere on the window to move it, and it moves relative to where you started.
	</p>

	<p>
		The underlying function, <code>windowMouse()</code> is also available to use. This does not provide the tracking
		and position information that <code>draggable</code> does, but it does handle all events after the initial
		<code>mousedown</code>, and it tracks mouse movement on the window (hence the name), not the DOM element,
		which prevents sticky drags from the mouseup happening off-element and other related issues.
	</p>

	<p>
		The lack of tracking is why the box with <code>windowMouse</code> snaps itself to align the top left with the
		mouse cursor. The only position information in the event is related to the mouse pointer. Of course, if this is
		all you need, <code>windowMouse</code> is available. If you want simple relative drags, there's <code>draggable</code>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code>@superfleb/draggable</code> package provides interfaces for React (with <code>usedraggable</code> and
		<code>useWindowMouse</code> hooks), for Vue (with similar composables), for non-library JavaScript by
		exporting functions, and this standalone version, which allows you to add <code>fleb-draggable.js</code> with
		a simple <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag and use the <code>$dd</code> object in the global scope.
	</p>

	<p>
		This does use modern ES2017 JavaScript (sorry, Internet Explorer), so a relatively modern browser is necessary.

	// First put elements to variables, because nobody likes typing "document.getElementById" over and over.
	const draggableElement = document.getElementById("draggable");
	const draggableDisplayElement = document.getElementById("draggable-display");
	const windowMouseElement = document.getElementById("window-mouse");

	// This is a utility function we'll call later. It just sets the element's position.
	const moveElement = (element, x, y) => {
		element.style.left = x + "px";
		element.style.top = y + "px";
	};

	// This gets our element's starting X and Y position, which will be used as the initial X/Y for the drag.
	const draggableBox = draggableElement.getBoundingClientRect();
	let lastPositionState = {
		x: draggableBox.left,
		y: draggableBox.top
	};

	// First, our draggable() element...
	const {mouseDownHandler, unmountHandler: unmountdraggable} = $dd.draggable({

		// A move handler-- all handlers provide both the event and the "dragState" object
		onMove(e, dragState) {
			draggableDisplayElement.innerText = JSON.stringify(dragState, undefined, 2);
			moveElement(draggableElement, dragState.x, dragState.y);
		},

		// Called when the drag ends...
		onEnd(e, dragState) {
			draggableDisplayElement.innerText = "LAST DRAG ENDED AT...\n" + JSON.stringify(dragState, undefined, 2);
			// Update lastPositionState so the next drag starts where the last one ended.
			lastPositionState = {x: dragState.x, y: dragState.y};
		},

		// There are two "transformer" hooks: xyOnStart and xyOnMove. These let you set or derive your own x,y values
		// from outside data (such as the window position) or derived from the event and dragState.
		xyOnStart: (e, dragState) => lastPositionState
	});

	// To apply it to an element, just use the "mousedown" handler it returns
	draggableElement.addEventListener("mousedown", mouseDownHandler);

	// (It also returns an "unmount" handler for when the element doesn't need to be live any more. That's used below.)

	// windowMouse is more basic. It's the base that draggable is built on. It only has handlers with DOM MouseEvent objects.
	// You'll notice that in this code, the draggable snaps to where the mouse cursor is (plus [10, 10]) because
	// there's no calculation based on the original position.
	const {mouseDownHandler: wmMouseDownHandler, unmountHandler: wmUnmount} = $dd.windowMouse({
		// The handler for movement during a drag.
		dragMoveHandler(e) {
			moveElement(windowMouseElement, e.clientX - 10, e.clientY - 10);
		}
	});

	// ...and we make the windowMouse element live.
	windowMouseElement.addEventListener("mousedown", wmMouseDownHandler);

	// Normally, unmounting would be done by a component library or something. Here, it's just attached to the button.
	document.getElementById("unmount").addEventListener("mousedown", unmountAll);
